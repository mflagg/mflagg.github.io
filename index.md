## Longer Bio

In 2010, after completing his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, Flagg joined Sight Commerce, Inc., a personal photo enhancement startup for the beauty industry in La Jolla, CA.  Taaz was founded by Dr. Satya Mallick and Professor David Kriegman to commercialize Satya's Ph.D. work at UCSD on editing reflection components of multi-channel images.  After two exciting years at Taaz, Flagg started a new company named Play Vision Labs.  Three years later, Flagg re-joined forces with Satya Mallick to focus on growing a consulting firm named [Big Vision](https://bigvision.ai) in 2015.  Flagg and Mallick have collaborated on a wide range of projects since then with continual business growth driven by Satya's popular blog learnopencv.com and his leadership as CEO of the [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org) organization.
