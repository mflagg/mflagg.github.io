Taaz was founded by Dr. Satya Mallick and Professor David Kriegman to commercialize Mallick's Ph.D. work at UCSD on editing reflection components of multi-channel images.  After two exciting years at Taaz, Flagg started a new company named Play Vision Labs.  Three years later, Flagg re-joined forces with Mallick to focus on consulting in computer vision and AI.
