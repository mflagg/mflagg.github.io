## Extended Bio

In 2010, after completing his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, Flagg joined Taaz, a personal photo enhancement startup for the beauty industry in La Jolla, CA.  Taaz was founded by Dr. Satya Mallick and Professor David Kriegman to commercialize Mallick's Ph.D. work at UCSD on editing reflection components of multi-channel images.  After two exciting years at Taaz, Flagg started a new company named Play Vision Labs.  Three years later, Flagg re-joined forces with Mallick to focus on consulting in computer vision and AI.  Flagg and Mallick have collaborated on a wide range of projects since then with continual business growth driven by Mallick's popular blog [ learnopencv.com ](https://learnopencv.com) and his leadership as CEO of the [OpenCV](https://www.opencv.org) organization.
